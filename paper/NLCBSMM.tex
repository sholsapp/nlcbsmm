\begin{abstract}
This paper presents \projname{}: a release consistent distributed shared memory (DSM) system built entirely in user-space.  The \projname{} system is capable of executing threaded applications implemented with \verb,pthreads, on a cluster of networked machines without \em any \em modifications to the target application, making the system a general DSM solution compared to others that require specially written applications or memory annotations.  The \projname{} system is a distributed layer built atop Hoard~\cite{Berger:1999:HFS:899944, Berger:2000:HSM:356989.357000}: a fast, scalable, and memory-efficient allocator for shared-memory multiprocessors.

In our analysis, we discuss various memory coherence models and their applicability to existing software distributed shared memory (SDSM) systems, we discuss how SDSM systems can be straight-forward to implement in a Linux environment, and lastly, we present preliminary performance characteristics that the release consistent distributed shared memory system exhibits.  In our presentation of performance characteristics, we show that network faults can be resolved in as little as 3 milliseconds with our implementation, we provide a comparison between runtime performance between \projname{} and the system provided non-networked version of \verb,malloc,, and lastly a comparison between various memory coherency models.
